# Introduction

In this practical we will go through practical applications of quantile quantile plots (QQ plots) and look at interpreting results. We went through the most common way they are used to check for normality. You can of course use them to compare observed data to any distribution. During this exercise we will use as example data randomly generated data and a the `mtcars` data-set built into R.

# QQ Plot

Let us go through creating a QQ plot from scratch, this will give you a good understanding of what happens in the background when you use the `qqplot` functions in R.

We will make a start by generating some random data sampled from a normal distribution \(\operatorname{N}(\mu = 5, \sigma^2 = 4)\).

The first step is to sort the data, and then can create quantiles. We can create na誰ve quantiles based on this data first.

When we create theoretical quantiles we want to center them. You can check this yourself try `qnorm(0)` and `qnorm(1)`. Instead we adjust the ranks by \(1/2\) to get a centered bins. There is an inbuilt function in R that also performs this adjustment, `ppoints`. *Remember to check how it works using `?ppoints`*

You can see that the first quantile 0.05 becomes 0.025. We will use the sample mean and sample standard deviation. We also want to project our data on the standard normal distribution as that is how a QQ plot is generated. It is just a simple transformation and we can plot the two values to convince ourselves that is the case.

The next thing we need is to create is the reference line to assess if the empirical quantiles correspond to the theoretical ones from the distribution we are comparing to. There are two lines we could consider, it is either the na誰ve line\(y = mean + s \times x\), where \(s\) is the sample standard deviation and the mean is the sample mean. The other option is a robust line which works better especially if there is deviation from the normal in the sample, here we replace the mean with the median and the standard deviation with the interquartile range.

Let us put everything together and create a plot with both the na誰ve and robust lines.

You can see that there is a small difference between the two lines but it can be larger depending on the data.

# Plotting

Everything above was just to gain an understanding of what goes into a QQ plot. Of course you would not go through this whole process every time you want to create such a plot. Instead you would use inbuilt functions in R.

Let's first recreate the plots based on the above data to check it's working and ensure we have performed the correct steps. We will use both base R plots and `ggplot`

First we use `ggplot` and you will note that instead of providing the `x` or `y` aesthetics we provide the the `sample` aesthetics. *As usual to learn more about this use `?stat_qq` and `?stat_qq_line` to learn more about these.*



```{r}

# Random seed, there is no significance to the number used
set.seed(1214)
# create random number sampled from a normal distribution
x <- rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 2)

x_sort <- sort(x)

rank(x_sort) / length(x_sort)

# Emperical quantiles
eq <- (rank(x_sort) - 0.5) / length(x_sort)

# Emperical quantiles using ppoints
eq_p <- ppoints(length(x_sort))

# Check if the two ways produce an identical vector
#print(identical(eq, eq_p))

# Print the values
print(eq)

# Theoretical quantiles
tq <- qnorm(eq, mean(x_sort), sd(x_sort))

# Quantiles for Standard noraml
tq_sn <- qnorm(eq, 0, 1)

# Plot the two values
# You will see that it is simple transformation. All values are on straight line
#plot(tq, tq_sn)


```

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

#create data frame
QQ <- data.frame(x_sort, eq, tq_sn)

# Add the na誰ve line
QQ$naive <- mean(x_sort) + sd(x_sort) * tq_sn

# Add the robust line into the data.frame
QQ$qq_line <- median(x_sort) + IQR(x_sort) * tq_sn

ggplot(data=QQ, aes(x=tq)) + geom_point(aes(y=x_sort), size=3) + geom_line(aes(y=naive), col="blue", linewidth=0.2) + geom_line(aes(y=qq_line), col="red", linewidth=0.2) + xlab("Theoretical Quantiles") + ylab("Sample Quantiles") 
```

```{r}

ggplot(data=QQ, aes(sample=x_sort)) +stat_qq() + stat_qq_line(col="blue")

#You can also use base R to create these plots using the functions `qqnorm` and `qqline`. Check the help functions for these before making use of them.

# Create a plot of sample quantiles and theoretical quantiles with a reference line
qqnorm(x_sort, frame=FALSE)
qqline(x_sort, col="blue")


```

We can see that all plots we have created above yield the same results. Both work but `ggplot` has more versatility. Let us look at that using the `mtcars` data.

# Interpreting QQ Plots

The main reason we use QQ plots is to assess if our data can be from a specific distribution. Usually we will perform this test to check for normality. This can be important if we perform a statistical test that makes the normality assumption. Since it is only a visual test it is subjective.

In QQ plot we are putting our data in quantiles and answering the questions: how similar are these sample quantiles to the theoretical values from a probability distribution. We put each data point we observe into its own quantile and compare them to a theoretical probability distribution.

Obviously, because we are looking at subjective visual comparison it is important to understand what these comparisons mean. To do that we will first create a few functions to make it easier to go from random sample to plot.

## Standard Normal

Now we can start comparing, we will start with the simplest comparison. Here we will sample from a normal distribution with \(\operatorname{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1)\).

## Skewed data

Now we will look at data that is skewed in either directions, which we can see on the histogram and what that looks like on the QQ plot. We will make use of filtering the vector of data using the square brackets. If we have a vector `vec_a` we can subset (or filter) all values smaller than zero by using `vec_b <- vec_a[vec_a < 0]`. This new vector `vec_b` contains all entires in `vec_a` that are smaller than 0.

If the data is left skewed as in this case, you can see that the histogram is shifted to the left compared to the standard normal distribution. You can see a proportion of the data on the left tail of the distribution. Now looking at the corresponding QQ plot we can see the first two quantiles are blow the theoretical (diagonal) line. The points above 0 are close to the diagonal but below 0 the points deviate from the diagonal. If you see such a QQ plot, the interpretation is that the data is left skewed.

## Symmetric Tails

We can also have tails which are symmetric on both sides. We distinguish between fat tailed and thin tailed distributions. We will again create such data and look at how we can identify them in a QQ plot. We wills tart with at fat tailed example.

Here we can see the histogram there is more data located both to the right and left of the standard normal distribution drawn as a red line. When we look at the QQ plot we see that the first quantiles are smaller than the corresponding theoretical values. For larger quantiles the values are larger than the theoretical values.

We can now look at thin tailed, the easiest way to simulate this is by using a normal distribution with variance smaller than 1.

Here we can see that the histogram of the data indicating a distribution narrower than the standard normal distribution. Here it is a little tricker to see in the QQ plot but you should notice that the initial quartiles have values higher than the diagonal and the last quantiles have values smaller than the diagonal. This is the opposite behavior compared to the fat tailed distribution.

```{r}

# convert the cyl varibale in the data into factors
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Look at the top 6 rows of the data.frame
head(mtcars)

ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(sample=mpg, color=cyl)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() 

# function to plot histogram and distribution for comparison
hist_comp  <- function(x, n_breaks = 30, title, xs, norm_dens) {
  hist(x, breaks = n_breaks, xlab = "Sample Value", ylab = "",
       freq = FALSE, main = title, ylim = c(0, 0.45))

         xs = xs, norm_dens = norm_dens)

qq_comp(data_sample)

# artificially using the same data as above

qq_comp(nor_skew_left)
